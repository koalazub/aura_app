This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Installation Guide
Make sure you're in the folder at the command line 

* Run `flutter pub get`

If wanting to run in iOS - you'll need to initialise your CocoaPods

* Change to ios folder
* Run `pods init`
* Run `pods install`

That should be it

This project connects to Google Firebase and so you'll need your own GoogleService-info.plist for iOS and the same goes for Android. 
Might include later on once I get the usages working
